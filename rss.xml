            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google May Have Found a Way to Make the Real-World Web Work</h1><p>Remember beacons? Honestly, there's not much reason you would. Hailed for years by Apple, Google, and beyond as one of the next big things in tech-for marketers, at least-the glorious beacon future has yet to arrive in the present.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Brooklyn's Luft Coffee</h1><p>About five years ago, Blair Smith's twice-a-day coffee pitstop at NYC's Kaffe 1668 led to him striking up a friendship with barista Justin Rodriguez behind the counter. Smith then met mobile developer Aaron Sutula in a coffee seminar held by an espresso machine company. "I took a day off of work to go," remembers Sutula.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f4cab8b5548c02525515410d6e85dd5580051ec9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
